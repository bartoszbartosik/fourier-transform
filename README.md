# Discrete Fourier Transform
## Introduction
The Fourier Transform is a mathematical tool which is used to express given function in a domain of frequencies, 
which this function consists. In other words, the idea is to assume, that the function which is the object of the 
analysis, is a sum of sinusoids of different amplitudes, frequencies and phase shifts.
